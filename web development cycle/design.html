            The design gives life to the graphics, colors,animations,buttons,drop-down and popup menu and the look and feel of the website. In the design phase, it is essential to embed elements like the logo of the company and the colours that help to enhance the identification of the company on the website.</p> 
        <p> 
            It also helps make the website more smooth and enjoyable to the reader. Meeting the demand of the audience with the help of web design is also crucial. If the design is mundane, the website will not be able to capture the user's attention, and this will increase the bounce rate. The elements should reflect the brand image as well as the business vision.
