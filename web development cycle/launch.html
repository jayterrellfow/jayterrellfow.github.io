            The launch step of the Web Development Cycle is when the website finally goes live and becomes accessible to users. This involves doing some final tests to make sure everything works well across different devices and browsers. Then, the website is moved from a staging or testing environment to the live server, and the domain name is set up so people can find it online. It's also important to optimize the site for faster loading and add security measures to keep it safe. After the site is live, it's essential to keep an eye on it, fix any problems that come up, and listen to user feedback. This step is the bridge between building the site and having it available for the world to see and use.
