        The launch step of the Web Development Cycle is when the website is finally made available to the public. Before the website goes live you'll do some final testing to make sure everything works properly on different devices and browsers. Then you move the site from your development environment to the live server and set up the domain so people can find it online. It's also a good idea to fix the site for faster loading and add security features. Once everything is live, you'll keep an eye on the site to fix any issues that come up and make sure it runs smoothly. This is the moment when the website is ready for people to see it and starts serving its purpose.
